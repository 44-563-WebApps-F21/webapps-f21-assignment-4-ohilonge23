<h1> The Duchess of Padua </h1>

<h2> ACT II: Room in the Duke's Palace (36 minutes) </h2>
<p>
<h5> DUKE </h5>
<p>
    No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
    Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.
 </p>
<h5> MAFFIO [_excitedly_] </h5>
 <p>
    Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
    Who every moment grow more clamorous.
</p>
 <h5> DUKE </h5>
<p> 
    Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
    People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
    The only men I fear are silent men.
 
                                                <p>[_A yell from the people_.]</p>
 
    You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.
 
                                                          <p>[_Another yell_.]</p>
 
    Go, Petrucci,
    And tell the captain of the guard below
    To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
    Do what I bid you.
 
                                                         <p>[_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>
 </p>
 <h5> CARDINAL </h5>
 <p>
    I beseech your Grace
    To listen to their grievances.
 </p>
 <h5> DUKE [_sitting on his throne_] </h5>\
 <p>
    Ay! the peaches
    Are not so big this year as they were last.
    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
    I thought you spake of peaches.
 
                                               <p>[_A cheer from the people_.]</p>
 
    What is that?
 </p>
 <h5> GUIDO [_rushes to the window_] </h5>
 <p>
    The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
    And stands between the people and the guard,
    And will not let them shoot.
</p> 
 <h5> DUKE </h5>
 <p>
    The devil take her!
</p>
 <h5> GUIDO [_still at the window_] </h5>
 <p>
    And followed by a dozen of the citizens
    Has come into the Palace.
 </p>
 <h5> DUKE [_starting up_] </h5>
 <p>
    By Saint James,
    Our Duchess waxes bold!
 </p>
 <h5> BARDI </h5>
 <p>
    Here comes the Duchess. 
    </p>
