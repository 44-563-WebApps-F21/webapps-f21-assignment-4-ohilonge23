<h5 class="DUKE"> DUKE </h5>
<p class="speech">
    No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
    Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.
 </p>
<h5 class="MAFFIO"> MAFFIO [_excitedly_] </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
    Who every moment grow more clamorous.
</p>
 <h5 class="DUKE"> DUKE </h5>
<p class="speech"> 
    Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
    People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
    The only men I fear are silent men.
 
                                                <p class="stage-direction">[_A yell from the people_.]</p>
 
    You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.
 
                                                          <p class="stage-direction">[_Another yell_.]</p>
 
    Go, Petrucci,
    And tell the captain of the guard below
    To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
    Do what I bid you.
 
                                                         <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>
 </p>
 <h5 class="CARDINAL"> CARDINAL </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    I beseech your Grace
    To listen to their grievances.
 </p>
 <h5 class="DUKE"> DUKE [_sitting on his throne_] </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    Ay! the peaches
    Are not so big this year as they were last.
    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
    I thought you spake of peaches.
 
                                               <p class="stage-direction">[_A cheer from the people_.]</p>
 
    What is that?
 </p>
 <h5 class="GUIDO"> GUIDO [_rushes to the window_] </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
    And stands between the people and the guard,
    And will not let them shoot.
</p> 
 <h5 class="DUKE"> DUKE </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    The devil take her!
</p>
 <h5 class="GUIDO"> GUIDO [_still at the window_] </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    And followed by a dozen of the citizens
    Has come into the Palace.
 </p>
 <h5 class="DUKE"> DUKE [_starting up_] </h5>
 <p class="speech">
    By Saint James,
    Our Duchess waxes bold!
 </p>
 <h5 class="BARDI"> BARDI </h5>
