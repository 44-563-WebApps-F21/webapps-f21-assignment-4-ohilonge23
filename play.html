<h1> The Duchess of Padua </h1>

<h2> ACT II: Room in the Duke's Palace (36 minutes) </h2>
<p>
    DUKE

    No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
    Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.
 
 MAFFIO [_excitedly_]
 
    Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
    Who every moment grow more clamorous.
 
 DUKE
 
    Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
    People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
    The only men I fear are silent men.
 
                                                [_A yell from the people_.]
 
    You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.
 
                                                          [_Another yell_.]
 
    Go, Petrucci,
    And tell the captain of the guard below
    To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
    Do what I bid you.
 
                                                         [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]
 
 CARDINAL
 
    I beseech your Grace
    To listen to their grievances.
 
 DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]
 
    Ay! the peaches
    Are not so big this year as they were last.
    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
    I thought you spake of peaches.
 
                                               [_A cheer from the people_.]
 
    What is that?
 
 GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]
 
    The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
    And stands between the people and the guard,
    And will not let them shoot.
 
 DUKE
 
    The devil take her!
 
 GUIDO [_still at the window_]
 
    And followed by a dozen of the citizens
    Has come into the Palace.
 
 DUKE [_starting up_]
 
    By Saint James,
    Our Duchess waxes bold!
 
 BARDI
 
    Here comes the Duchess.
